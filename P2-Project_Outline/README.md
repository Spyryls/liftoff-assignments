# Project Outline
(For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.)

I would like to build a website that can house, showcase, and sell my own personal artwork. I want it to be dynamic and have various functions such a pay page, user comments, personal bio, inspirations reference, and contact information. I would like it to have a simplistic look but be able to adapt it and change it as I need. 

## Assignment Description

Pages that I would like to include
Home: This will be a the base landing page for people who log in or to simply peruse the site.
Bio: This would be a place for me to place my artist bio and statement along with a photo.
Gallery: I would use this to showcase my work, possibly give short explanations of the thought processes, and display images.
